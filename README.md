# 4Loop: A Generative RPG
Made for McHacks 12
## Inspiration
The Oasis Decart Generative Game Engine for Minecraft:
https://oasis.decart.ai/introduction

## What it does
Generates sprites, map tiles, dialogue, combat moves, etc by leveraging Gumloop AI Automation. Users enter their prompt and 4Loop generates a custom Role-Playing Game experience, story and world.

## How we built it
We leveraged Gumloop AI Automation to analyze prompts and generate assets, dialogue, etc. for the game. We built the game using phaser.js with Typescript and React.

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges figuring out how to perfectly generate sprites for the game. Also started took a bit longer as we were learning Phaser as we went along through the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing a larger scale application in the limited time allocated.

## What we learned
We learned how to utilize Gumloop's API to generate assets and integrate their API within the scope of a JS Video Game. We also learned how to build a game using Phaser.js.
## What's next for 4Loop
Improve game engine by creating a custom one and increasing scope.
